Corporate-Run
It exist because I missed my  boring team meetings .

INTRODUCTION:

> “You were peacefully minding your own business when — BAM — a thief stole your gold. Now run like your rent’s due tomorrow!”

Corporate-Run is a 3D endless runner game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Three.js**, playable directly in the browser. It features dynamic terrain, dodgy obstacles, suspiciously well-placed buildings, bystanders who don’t care you're sprinting for your life, and trees that watch silently.
